# Introduction #

Ajax, as stated previously, stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. Now, not everyone
agrees that Ajax is the proper term for what it represents, but even those who are
critical of the term cannot help but understand the implications it stands for and the
widespread fame that the technology has received, partly as a result of its new moniker.

Basically, what Ajax does is make use of the JavaScript-based XMLHttpRequest object
to fire requests to the web server asynchronously—or without having to refresh the
page. However most of our controls does not require XMLHttpRequest.


# Ajax Requirements #

Since Ajax is based upon JavaScript technology, it goes without saying that JavaScript
must be enabled in the user’s browser in order for it to work. That being said, most people do allow their browsers to use JavaScript, and it is not really that much of a security issue to have it in place. It must be noted, however, that the user does have the ability to effectively “disable” Ajax.

Ajax is a fairly widely supported concept across browsers, and can be invoked on
Firefox (all available versions), Internet Explorer (4.0 and higher), Apple Safari (1.2 and higher), Konqueror, Netscape (7.1 and higher), and Opera (7.6 and higher). Therefore,
most browsers across the widely used gamut have a means for handling Ajax and its
respective technologies.
