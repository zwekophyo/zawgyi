# List of converters #

## Prince Ka Naung ##

[Prince Ka Naung](http://kanaung.googlecode.com) is Burmese code conversion engine for various Burmese fonts encoded text data. There are three implimentation of convertors in Prince Ka Naung:

  1. ASM
  1. C#
  1. C++

Although in the same project, each implimentation has different logic for conversion. All of them are active and fixing bug upon reported issue.

## Burglish ##

[Burglish](http://burglish.googlecode.com) is the first open source offering extensive Myanmar font conversion and now spinn off as Prince Ka Naung project. Python implimentation is very flexible using JSON format for defining conversion logic and easily maintained. Some core logic in C# implimentation of Prince Ka Naung are generated by this generator.

## Leikpyar ##

[The online Leikpyar convertor](http://mmbotconvert.vndv.com/) is ready to convert Zawgyi <> Unicode 5.1. [Project home](http://leikpyar.googlecode.com).

## Girlza convertor ##

[Girlza convertor](http://www.girlza.com/my.php) converts Burmese in Planet font to the MyaZedi Unicode-based font. It is based on PHP server technology. The web site is slow but working.


# Technology #

## TECkit ##

[TECkit](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&cat_id=TECkit) is a low-level toolkit intended to be used by other applications that need to perform encoding conversions (e.g., when importing legacy data into a Unicode-based application). The primary component of the TECkit package is therefore a library that performs conversions; this is the "TECkit engine". The engine relies on mapping tables in a specific binary format (for which documentation is available); there is a compiler that creates such tables from a human-readable mapping description (a simple text file).

## SILConverters ##

[This package](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=EncCnvtrs) provides tools through which you can change the encoding, font, and/or script of text in Microsoft Word and other Office documents, XML documents, and SFM text and lexicon documents. It also installs a system-wide repository to manage your encoding converters and transliterators (TECkit,  CC,  ICU, Perl, or Python based, as well as support for adding custom transduction engines). For developers, it provides a simple COM interface to select and use a converter from the repository. It is easy to use from VBA, C++, C#, Perl, Python or any .NET/COM enabled language.  This package is fully integrated with SIL FieldWorks, AdaptIt, and the forthcoming Speech Analyzer 3.0 and Phonology Assistant 3.0 software, providing the same system-wide registry of installed and available encoding converters for all of these user programs. Additionally the package includes some extra utilities such as a clipboard converter for manipulating text between cut and paste operations.

## ICU ##

[International Components for Unicode](http://www.icu-project.org/)] is a mature, widely used set of C/C++ and Java libraries providing Unicode and Globalization support for software applications. ICU is widely portable and gives applications the same results on all platforms and between C/C++ and Java software. PHP wraper module for ICU can be found [ICU here](http://au2.php.net/intl). However, due to its focus on Encoding version rather then re-ordering of text data, it is also not very application here.

As always [wikipedia discription](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Components_for_Unicode) are more readable and has balance opinion.
